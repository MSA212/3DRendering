# 3DRendering
A from-scratch 3D software renderer written in Python that implements the core stages of a modern graphics pipeline without relying on OpenGL, DirectX, or engine-level abstractions.  This project focuses on fundamental rendering concepts, performance-aware design, and system-level clarity, rather than visual polish.
